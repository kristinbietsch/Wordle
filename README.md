R code to help me beat my friends in a friendly competition

There are 5 sections to this R code
 1 Pick your vowel list- these are all the 5 letter words that contain that vowel
 2 Edit your "no go" list- these are the grey letters
 3 Edit your code for misplaced letter- these are your yellow letters
 4 Edit your known letter placement code- these are your green letters
  
 5 Then, after running the above code, you can use the next chunk of code to tell you which letters are most common in the remaining list of popular words- use this to inform your next word choose.
  
 Then repeat steps 2-5!  
 
 I always start with the same first two words to find my vowels and some common consonants- you can pick any words you want to start....
